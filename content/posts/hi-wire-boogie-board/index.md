I got this from a neat little craft beer store and brewery in Waynesville, NC - Blue Ridge Beer Hub.  Even though the can is labelled
[Hi-Wire Brewing](https://hiwirebrewing.com/our-story/), apparently it's brewed and canned by Three Ring Brewing Co, out of Asheville, NC.  Three
Rings appears to be a parent company of some kind, although a quick search doesn't clarify much about that.  This particular brew isn't listed on
Hi-Wire's online beer store though.  After a more thorough interrogation of the can's labeling, it appears that this beer may be some kind of special
limited-edition run produced in collaboration with [Tiki Easy Bar](https://tikieasybar.com/#home-about) out of Asheville, NC.

The vibe of the can art made me think this was going to be a good deal sweeter than it actually is.  It's a fruit beer, and lives solidly up to that
label, but it tastes like a "natural" fruit beer type thing with no added sweeteners.  I was almost turned off by it at first, but I'm growing to
appreciate it as a somewhat more "grown-up" take on what would otherwise probably be just another generic canned sugar-bomb wrapped in glaring neon
colors like the migrane-inducing lights in the windows of a Detroit liquor store.

It's a fairly stong brew, weighing in at 7.5% ABV.  The most prominant flavor is pineapple, I think, although it claims to be brewed with guava,
cherry, and lemon peel as well.  The smell I get from it is kind of like generic fruit juice cocktail, with none of the fruits showing relative
strength.

Angela thought the lemon was most apparent, and liked that a lot, but thought it tasted a little watered down.  I agree with that in that the flavors
aren't quite as strong as I'd like them to be, though I'm glad it's not too overpowering.  She also mentioned that it's not quite as fruity and sweet
as the can art would have you believe, but noted that it's a pleasantly refreshing drink.  I'd very much agree - in the same way that a home-made
fruit smoothie is refreshing.  

This beer makes me want to bring it to something fun that I'm doing with friends or family outside, or on a beach, in the sun.  It's a good vacation  
beer.
