I got this one from Blue Ridge Beer Hub as well.  It's brewed by [Eurisko Beer Co](https://euriskobeer.com/about/), out of Asheville, NC.  It seems
that they're a combination brewery and tap room somewhere in downtown Asheville.  They seem to have quite a selection of brews, including quite a few
that are of similar or higher strength.  I see that it's an unfiltered beer, which makes me wish that I'd realized that and poured some out into a
glass to have a closer look at it.  The first unfiltered beer that I remember knowingly drinking was in a Shanghai tourist bar.  I've no recollection
of what it was, so it must've been alright.  Turns out there's not much else written on this can that I haven't already covered below, so, that's
neat.

It's strong - 9% ABV, but it has a good amount of flavor for such a strong drink.  Sometimes when breweries play in this league they just turn out
like flavored diesel, but not this one.  Straight away I noticed the smell.  It made me think of that sparkling grape juice that they sell around new
year's in the states.  Interestingly, the taste is quite a bit different.  It's labelled as a "Cherry Pie Ale", brewed with vanilla and pie crust.
Normally when I see such things on the side of a beer can, high expectations go out the window, but something made me want to give this a try anyway.

Cherry is definitely the strongest flavor here, but it's not the sweet, artificial cherry like what you'd find in a Jolly Rancher.  Strangely, it's
more like the cherry you'd find in Robitussin.  I'm not a huge fan of that, but it does give it a more "adult" flavor than if it were just loaded up
with sugar and fake flavors.  I really don't taste any of the vanilla or pie crust anywhere.  

This probably isn't one that I'd seek out all that often, but it does have a place.  If at some point it was had again, it's the kind of thing that I
would want to enjoy in one of two settings that come to mind: while sitting quietly in a study reading a good fiction novel, or while watching a good
classic horror movie in the dark.
