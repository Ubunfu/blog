I picked this up at a Food Lion when I went on a vacation down south.  What drew me to it at the store was simply the design on the can and that it
was a unique beer that wasn't an IPA or something super bitter like that.  IPAs basically all taste the same - like a rusty spoon.

# Taste
The first thing I notice about it is the crisp, shocking initial bite of it.  It has a fairly fresh taste to it, and as the can suggests, I can
clearly taste citrus, but pretty much just orange.  It's very similar to Blue Moon's Belgian White in this way.  The aftertaste is almost sour, but it
doesn't drink like a real sour - it just kind of creeps up on you at the end.  The other prominent flavor is the spices.  It tastes a little bit
black-peppery.  

# Feel
This drink seems to have the mouth feel of smaller bubbles - somewhere between the large bubble feel of a carbonated soda, and the creamy tiny bubbles
of a nitro drink.

# Temperature
The flavors develop noticably as the beer starts to warm up a little bit, and I think it tastes better.  I estimate about 5 mins above
cooler temp is about perfect.  

# Usage
This would be a good beer to bring to a party where youâ€™re not getting trashed, a light hearted game night (not something intense like DnD), or a camp
fire on a warm summer night.  It's the kind of brew that helps to cool off, but it has the pleasant heft that you'd appreciate from a craft brew.  It
doesn't lend itself to careless slogging, and it has enough good flavor you're careful to waste it.
