During a recent trip to the local gym, I headed to the locker room after finishing my workout.  When I got to my locker, I entered the same 4-letter
combination to the same Master lock that I've used for years, but the lock wouldn't budge.  At first I thought I was standing in front of the wrong
locker, and briefly contemplated the odds that someone else had the exact same model of lock, at the same gym, at the same time, in roughly the same
spot as I chose.  No way though, this was definitely me.  

I spent probably 10 mins trying various methods of wiggling the dials around hoping that maybe I could just knock something into place and it would
pop open like always, but no dice.  I resigned myself to the idea that I would have to go up to the desk, hat in hand, and ask if they could maybe...
like...  cut my lock off...  As I walked out there, I recall running through the anticipated conversation in my head, trying to cobble together a way
to string my words together in such a way that would minimize suspicion of any wrong-doing or mal-intent.  For sure I'd have some explaining to do.

When I got up there, I broke into the conversation between the kid ("Kid") running the desk and the guy who I assume was the general manager ("GM").
I somewhat sheepishly said something on the order of, "...I'm not really sure what the protocol is here, but is there any chance you might be able to
cut my lock off my locker?  I'm not sure why the combo isn't working tonight."  Without hesitation, Kid immediately responded, "oh yea, no problem.
I'll have to go back and get the bolt cutters, would you just meet me back there and show me which one it is?"

*Me:*

I vividly recall him turning back to the GM and asking, "oh do you like, need to watch me while I'm doing this or?...", which I thought was
interesting.  "Nope go ahead your're good."

We walk back into the locker room, and after a moment he returns from the store closet with a set of arm-length bolt-cutters, and effortlessly pops
the hinge in two, sending it flying off the locker.  He's barely got the pieces in his hand and he's running back to the front desk to let me get on
with my things.  Now that I'm without a lock, I elect to save the shower for home, collect my things, and be on my way for the night.

As I walk past the front desk, the GM walks up to me and hands me a brand new (albeit cheap, and objectively awful) gym-branded replacement lock, free
of charge.  Genuinely appreciating the gesture, I offer to buy it but he insists that "whenever [they] pop a lock," they like to give out one of
theirs to promote the brand, say thanks for being a customer, etc.  etc.  I thank him, and walk out to the car with a strange mixture of thoughts
about what just happened.

# What Went Wrong
Right away, it caught me off-guard that Kid was willing to break open my locker without bothering to do anything at all to verify who I was or that I
was the one who locked that locker.  He didn't even ask me my name, let alone press the issue, or try to think up some way for me to prove to him that
I should be let in the locker before he snapped it in two.  Based on the information I'd offered so far, there was absolutely no way for him to
whether I was being truthful about any of this.  This certainly can't be laid solely at the feet of Kid, especially since he looked young, might not
have been there that long, and was probably just following the lead of GM (who, again, was standing right there) or whatever brief training material
he'd been given.  GM certainly should have stepped in and taken responsibility to check into all of this before letting Kid do it.

What if I had actually been a bad actor in this situation?  What if I'd just walked into the gym off the street, wearing some normal-looking
basketball shorts and a loose T shirt, walked into the locker room, spotted a locker that had some expensive looking keys in it, and then, "Oh bother,
it looks like my lock isn't opening!...  Say, could you like, *just cut it off* for me?"  How would Kid and GM explain themselves to the guy who's
just had his wallet, $80k Mercedes, and grubby old Crocs stolen from his locker.  He'll be wrapping up his workout soon, and he'll want answers.

# What Could Be Better
Th easy answer here is that both Kid and GM should have required something to create a more reasonable level of confidence that I own the locker
contents.  The complication here is that things like my wallet, keys, and possibly my phone (which would seem to be the obvious solutions for this)
are all in the locked locker.

An imperfect solution to that might be for GM to bet the cost of a new lock and the frustration of another patron on whether or not I'm lying, cut the
lock, and ask me to describe the items inside with some level of detail.  My knowledge of what's inside beyond what you might be able to glean from
peering through the holes/slats in the locker might suggest that they belong to me.  Temporarily holding the items in "escrow" during this brief
process by stashing them in a back storage area and not releasing them unless I'm able to convince the staff of my ownership might help mitigate the
awkwardness of me failing the test.  That way Kid and I aren't standing there in front of an open locker with stuff in it, while Kid tries to figure
out how to tell me that he's *not* going to let me take it.  Sadly, there's a good chance that could get confrontational and put Kid at risk.

# What I Could Do
Since I hadn't considered that it could actually be this easy for someone to get staff to open a random locker that could be mine, I hadn't factored
that into decisions about things like which lock I would use.  I'm a somewhat security-conscious person, and YouTube channels like
[LockPickingLawyer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm9K6rby98W8JigLoZOh6FQ) have made me more aware of the value of choosing a good lock.  The lock
that failed was a fairly common variety of Master combination lock with a 4-letter combination and no keyed access.  It didn't stand a chance against
Kid and his bolt cutters though.  

The [Abus 24IB/50](https://abuslocks.com/products/24ib-50) keyed lock was suggested to me as an alternative that might be a little more secure.  I
think a lock like this would provide better protection against having my lock cut open, however, it solves one problem and *potentially* creates
another by way of exposing a keyed access port that seems to be [just as pick-able as the rest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKgq57TBHro) by a
sufficiently adept person.  Additionally, if this lock were to fail in the same way that my Master lock failed, I might have a lot more trouble
recovering my things.  What other option is there aside from physically defeating the lock?  Disassemble and possibly destroy the locker itself?

# Rule #1: Cardio
At the end of the day, everything is a trade-off, and the right choice is the choice that strikes a personally comfortable balance between risk
tolerance and cost.  If we find ourselves unable to reach an acceptable compromise, we may be able to turn to common zombie-virus outbreak survival
strategies to help us too - namely [Rule #1: Cardio](https://www.anythingzombie.com/the-33-rules-of-zombieland-how-to-survive-the-zombie-apocalypse).
If we can't perfectly insulate ourselves against thieves and miscreants, maybe we can at least make ourselves a less attractive target than the next
locker over.
